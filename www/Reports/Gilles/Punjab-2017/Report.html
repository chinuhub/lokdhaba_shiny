<li class="report" class="preport" style="text-align: left;">The 2017 Punjab Assembly elections have seen the Congress return to power after ten years, providing a much needed relief to a party that has been drifting without direction since its 2014 defeat.</li>
<li class="report" class="preport" style="text-align: left;">A close examination at the data however shows that the Punjab victory was decided by factors that were mostly out of the Congress&rsquo; hands, namely the iruption of AAP in the Punjab political stage and a strong anti-incumbency against the Akali-BJP alliance, and its Akali leaders in particular.</li>

<p class="preport"><strong>A stable turnout</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class="report">Punjab traditionally registers high turnout in state elections (with the exception of the 1992 elections, which were boycotted by the Akalis). Participation in the last three elections has been stable near 78 per cent.</li>
<li class="report">The introduction of a new player - AAP - has not boosted participation further. As in 2012, women have very slightly outvoted men.</li>
<li class="report">The equal participation of men and women voters in state elections is significant in a state that knows one of the worst sex ratio in the country.</li>
</ul>
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li class="report">In terms of party performance, the Congress remains ahead at 38.5 per cent of vote share, 1.5 per cent less than in 2012.</li>
<li class="report">In previous years, the Akali-BJP combine was sufficient to take over the Congress as the largest alliance. But with the brutal drop of vote share of the Akalis (from 34.7 to 25.2 per cent), and the continuing decline of the BJP (from 7.2 to 5.4 per cent), the alliance could not surpass the Congress.</li>
<li class="report">Two factors essentially have caused the decline of the Akalis. A strong anti-incumbency first and the rise of AAP, which nearly matches the Akalis vote share, with 23.7 per cent of the votes.</li>
</ul>
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li class="report">If we compare the 2017 elections with the 2014 General elections, we see that AAP basically maintains its 2014 vote share but loses 22 of the 33 assembly segments that it won in 2014. The party won nine new segments, for a total of 20 seats.</li>
<li class="report">The Akalis, too, also maintain their 2014 performance but lose 22 of the 29&nbsp; assembly segments that they had won in 2014, for a new total of 15 seats.</li>
<li class="report">In other words, results and vote share might look similar, but these elections have seen quite a bit of volatility on the ground.</li>
</ul>
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li class="report">This is confirmed by a simple measure of volatility, which shows the distribution of gains and losses for a party in an election.</li>
<li class="report">We see for instance that the decline of the BJP is uniform. With the exception of Abohar, where the BJP candidate scored 35 per cent more vote share than in 2012, the party loses across the seats it contested.</li>
</ul>
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="preport" class="preport" style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img class="chart" src="Reports/Gilles/Punjab-2017/Picture6.png" alt="" /></span></p>
<ul>
<li class="report">The same goes for the Akalis, who strengthen their presence in only five of the 94 seats it contested. The distribution of losses shows the amplitude of the decline.</li>
<li class="report">In Amritsar South, the party loses 35 percent of vote share, from 53 per cent of vote share, down to 17.8 per cent.</li>
</ul>
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="preport" class="preport" style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img class="chart" src="Reports/Gilles/Punjab-2017/Picture7.png" alt="" /></span></p>
<ul>
<li class="report">The Congress performance in terms of volatility is more mixed. It loses more votes than it gains.</li>
<li class="report">Congress&rsquo; most impressive gains are in urban seats, such as in Amritsar East (+32.5 per cent), Dera Bassi (+ 32 per cent), Mukerian (+ 31 per cent), and Pathankot (+ 25 per cent) and generally speaking in the Majha sub-region.</li>
<li class="report">But they also lose badly in a number of rural seats in the Malwa and Doab sub-regions.</li>
</ul>
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="preport" class="preport" style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img class="chart" src="Reports/Gilles/Punjab-2017/Picture8.png" alt="" /></span></p>
<ul>
<li class="report">What made the difference in these elections is the configuration of the distribution of votes, which determines the conversion of votes into seats.</li>
<li class="report">In the First-past-the-post system (FPTP), the more the votes are dispersed between major contestants, the less disproportionate the conversion of votes into seats become. When a major player suddenly loses substantial vote share, it reinforces the disproportionality effect of the FPTP, in favor of the dominant party. This is how vote losses translate into punishment in terms of seats.</li>
<li class="report">In this case, the collapse of the Akalis-BJP alliance enabled the Congress to convert its vote share into a greater vote share than usual. With 65.8 per cent of the seats, the Congress scores its best performance in Punjab since 1957 (excluding 1992, which was an&nbsp; outlier year due to the boycott).</li>
</ul>
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="preport" class="preport" style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img class="chart" src="Reports/Gilles/Punjab-2017/Picture9.png" alt="" /></span></p>
<ul>
<li class="report">In fact, The Congress doubles its seat share with a slightly lower vote share. The BJP and the Akalis are left with only 15 per cent of the seats, a historic low for the alliance.</li>
<li class="report">Comparing seat shares with 2014 also illustrates how small number variations can have large repercussions in terms of seats distribution.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li class="report">Strike rates basically confirm this effect. They also show how parties fare in an alliance. If the strike rates are similar, vote transfers between the partner was effective, If they are dissimilar, one partner drags the other down.</li>
<li class="report">In the case of Punjab in 2017, when compared to 2012 and 2014, both partners&rsquo; strike rates collapse. The BJP had maintained a good figure in 2014, thanks for the popularity of its leader. This clearly wasn&rsquo;t a factor three years later.</li>
</ul>

<p class="preport"><strong>The subregional performance of AAP</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class="report">The relatively poor performance of AAP comes from the fact that its vote share is concentrated in a specific sub-region, central Malwa.</li>
<li class="report">AAP&rsquo;s geographical spread remains the same as in 2014. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li class="report">Did the adverse performance of the Akalis affect the overall caste composition of the Assembly? On the overall, not really.</li>
<li class="report">Representational trends in Punjab have been somewhat stable over time, Jatt Sikhs occupying a dominant position in the Assembly. A reason of that domination, beyond questions of socio-economic status and the place of Jatt Sikhs in Punjab&rsquo;s society is the fact that they are well represented within the Akali Dal and the Congress. The eruption of AAP brings a bit more more diversity, most of its MLAs being SCs (9), OBCs (4), Jatt Sikhs (4) and two upper castes.</li>
<li class="report">In aggregate terms, it does not affect the overall balance of caste power within the Assembly.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p class="preport">&nbsp;<strong>The loss of women</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class="report">The 2017 Punjab elections represent a solid set-back for women&rsquo;s representation. The 2017 results effectively put an end to a thirth-two years trend of gradual increase of women representation in Punjab. In 2012, Punjab figured among the better states in terms of women representation, with 12 per cent of the seats won by women candidates. It drops down to 5 per cent, the lowest it has been since 1992. All major parties share equal responsibility for this sorry state of affairs.&nbsp;</li>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Analysis</h2>
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="preport"><strong>Who bites whom?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class="report">The data we have does not yet enable us to assert with certitude that AAP dented specifically or essentially into the support base of the Akalis. It is usually assumed from the fact that Arvind Kejriwal pandered the base of the Akali by engaging them through symbols, not the least conspicuous being the late Jarnail Singh Bindrawale, who figured prominently on AAP&rsquo;s billboards. But we also know that the Congress also suffered a number of substantial local losses, including in seats where AAP was the main opponent.</li>
</ul>
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li class="report">That being said, the main competition took place between SAD/BJP and Congress candidates. SAD or BJP candidates trail in 62 seats (they won 18) while AAP stands second in only 26 seats (but won 20).</li>
</ul>
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li class="report">The BSP also suffered a further erosion of its retracting base in Punjab. Its vote share has gone down from 4.3 per cent to 1.5 per cent between 2012 and 2017. It is possible that a part of the Dalit vote shifted towards AAP, which might contribute to explain its good performance in reserved seats.</li>
</ul>
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li class="report">These elections confirm that Punjab is its own political stage, relatively unaffected by national trends. In 2014, the Modi wave stopped at the border of Punjab, the BJP winning only two seats (the Akalis won 4).</li>
</ul>
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li class="report">A Congress victory will no doubt be welcomed as a sweetener after the routs that the party suffered in Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh.
<ul>
<li class="report">However, data shows that AAP&rsquo;s eruption into the political fray, a strong rejection of the Akali-BJP combine, created a void that the Congress could occupy without improving its position.</li>
<li class="report">The Congress won because of the strength of its state unit, and thanks to the lack of involvment of the national leadership in the campaign.</li>
<li class="report">Captain Amarinder Singh certainly has the merit of maintaining a leaking boat afloat, but the ability of the Congress to rebound more broadly from this victory remains placed under a question mark, as the party does not have the organizational strength that it has in Punjab in any other state. </li>
