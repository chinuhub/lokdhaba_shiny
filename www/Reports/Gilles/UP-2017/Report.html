<p class="preport">Observers were expecting a sharp increase of turnout, which did not materialize.</p>
<ul>
<li class="report">Participation rose from 59.4 per cent in 2012 to 61.14 in 2017, as per our calculations (based on provisionary data).</li>
<li class="report">Interestingly, the increase in turnout is carried almost exclusively by women, who outvoted men by more than three percentage point in these elections.&nbsp;</li>

<p class="preport">As in previous elections, turnout is higher in Western UP, Rohilkhand, Bundelkhand and Northern Awadh.</p>
<ul>
<li class="report">Eastern and North-Eastern UP generally see lower turnout.</li>
<li class="report">The intensification of the BJP campaign and the increased involvement of the Prime Minister haven&rsquo;t had much impact of turnout.</li>

<p class="preport"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>A narrowing competition</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li class="report">305 political parties contested the 2017 Uttar Pradesh election, a sharp increase compared to 2007 (222) in an exponential growth trajectory.</li>
<li class="report">At the same time, the number of parties represented in the Vidhan Sabha decreases election after election. 17 parties obtained representation in 2002 and that number has since decreased by a few units every election, down to 9 parties in 2017.</li>
<li class="report">The main reason for the narrowing of the competition is that voters choose to align more and more with major parties, reject micro and local formation and aim to strategically support a candidate or a party whom they think stand a chance of winning. If we assume that the relationship between voters and parties is transactional, that is based on exchange of votes and favors or access for services, then it does not make much sense to support parties who cannot hold their part of the transaction. If fragmentation was the defining feature of Uttar Pradesh politics through the 1980s and 1990s, we see a complete reversal of that trend.</li>
</ul>

<p class="preport"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>BJP's soaring voteshare</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li class="report">Just like in 2014, the BJP crushes its adversary with a soaring vote share, standing way ahead its opponents in most constituencies. This was not a close election by any stretch of the imagination.</li>
<li class="report">Between 2012 and 2017, the BJP scores an impressive gain of 24.7 per cent of vote share, that is more than the total vote share obtained by the BSP (22.2 per cent) or the SP (21.8 per cent).</li>
<li class="report">Earlier on, the party had peaked at 33 per cent of vote share in 1993 and had since declined, with a brutal drop between 1996 and 2002. In complete organizational disarray, the party had retracted to its traditional urban bastions. The forceful reorganization of the party and the building of branches in rural areas initiated ahead of the 2014 campaign paid off again three years later, as the BJP sweeps the majority of rural segments of the state.</li>
</ul>
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="preport" style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img class="chart" src="Reports/Gilles/UP-2017/Picture5.png" alt="" /></span></p>
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li class="report">The SP vote share is misleading since it contested in only 305 seats, due to the alliance with Congress. The SP&rsquo;s vote share in seats where it contested rises to 28.3 per cent, that is barely one per cent less than in 2012.</li>
<li class="report">In contrast, the Congress&rsquo; vote share in seats where it contested is only 22 per cent, which indicate that the alliance did not work well. For instance, considering only the seats where the SP contested, there is only five per cent point difference between the SP and the BJP in Rohilkhand. For the rest of the state, however, the gaps remain very important (15.5 per cent gap on average).</li>
</ul>
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="preport" style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img class="chart" src="Reports/Gilles/UP-2017/Picture6.png" alt="" /></span></p>
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li class="report">Comparing parties strike rates enables us to see in a different way how the Congress-SP alliance failed to take of. The SP&rsquo;s share of seats won against the number of seats contested (strike rate) is at a low 15.1 per cent. For the Congress, the strike rate is at 6.14 per cent, at par with its previous performances in Vidhan Sabha elections.</li>
<li class="report">In other words, wherever a Congress candidate contested, the alliance under-performed. It is too early to tell to what extent the Congress helped the SP to maintain its vote share where it contested, but it is already certain that the large number of tickets given to Congress candidates cost the SP a substantial amount of vote share which, in closely fought races, might have helped it to reduce the gap with the BJP in terms of seats.</li>

<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li class="report">A comparison of strike rates in assembly segments in 2014 and 2017 reveals further the similitude between the two elections.</li>
<li class="report">The SP and the BSP were more competitive in a small number of seats compared to 2014 but only marginally so.</li>
<li class="report">In the seats in which they contested, the BJP obtained 41.41% of average vote share, against 28.35% for SP, 22.18% for BSP and 22.15% for Congress.</li>
</ul>

<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li class="report">Another indicator of the BJP&rsquo;s strength is the size of its average victory margin &ndash; 15%.</li>
<li class="report">Congress candidates also won with large margins but SP and BSP winners got through through more competitive contests.</li>
<li class="report">The BSP&rsquo;s average victory margin is decreasing significantly over time, which indicates a greater difficulty of winning of its candidates, compared to other parties (except in 2007)</li>
</ul>
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li class="report">Geographically speaking, the Samajwadi Party is reduced to three clusters of seats: the historic strongholds of Etawah, Jaswantnagar and Mainpuri in Doab, where the members of the Yadav family contest. A cluster of seats in Rohilkhand, where the share of Muslim population is the highest, and a smaller cluster of seats in Eastern Uttar Pradesh, where the Muslim-Yadav social coalition is strong. A third of SP&rsquo;s MLAs are Muslims. In Suar, Azam Khan&rsquo;s son, Mohamed Abdullah Azan Khan, wins with a large margin of 25 per cent.</li>
<li class="report">The Congress is reduced to seven seats, including three in proximity of Rae Bareli.</li>
</ul>

<p class="preport" style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img class="chart" src="Reports/Gilles/UP-2017/Picture10.png" alt="" /></span></p>
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li class="report">In terms of seat share, the narrowing of the competition to three major parties and the distance between the BJP winners and their opponents strengthened the disproportionality effect of the electoral system. In other words, the BJP&rsquo;s 39.7 per cent vote share converted into 77 per cent of the seats, while the SP&rsquo;s 28 per cent per cent vote share where it contested only yielded 11 per cent of the seats.</li>
</ul>
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="preport" style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img class="chart" src="Reports/Gilles/UP-2017/Picture11.png" alt="" /></span></p>
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li class="report">The situation is worse for the BSP, who reaps only 4.7 per cent of the seats for 22 per cent vote share, and for the Congress, who despite bagging 22 per cent vote share in seats it contested, receives at the end less than two per cent of the seats.</li>
<li class="report">The BSP is literally swept from its strongholds in Western Uttar Pradesh, where the Dalit-Muslim combination clearly failed.</li>
</ul>
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="preport" style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img class="chart" src="Reports/Gilles/UP-2017/Picture12.png" alt="" /></span></p>
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="preport"><strong>Sub-regional variations</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class="report">In terms of sub-regional performance, the BJP&rsquo;s maintain most of its 2014 performance across the state. Barring in Western Uttar Pradesh, Eastern Uttar Pradesh and in Rohilkhand, where the BJP&rsquo;s vote share lightly decreased, the BJP has maintained its vote share across the rest of the territory.</li>
<li class="report">Compared to 2014, the Samajwadi Party consolidates its position in Awadh and in Eastern Uttar Pradesh. It suffers marginal losses in the rest of the state but generally succeeds to maintain its position. If we isolate the seats where the SP contested and compare with the same segment in 2014, the SP actually improves its position.</li>
</ul>
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="preport" style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img class="chart" src="Reports/Gilles/UP-2017/Picture13.png" alt="" /></span></p>
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="preport">Still compared to 2014, the BSP improves its position in every sub-region, without exception. This might mean that the party has succeeded to reconsolidate its core Jatav Dalit base.</p>
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="preport" style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img class="chart" src="Reports/Gilles/UP-2017/Picture14.png" alt="" /></span></p>
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li class="report">The wave character of the BJP&rsquo;s victory appears clearly when we look at vote swings between 2012 and 2017.</li>
<li class="report">Not only the BJP gains in nearly every seat (barring three), it gains quite massively across the territory. As such, the BJP no longer has strongholds, as the state has virtually become a BJP stronghold.</li>
</ul>
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="preport" style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img class="chart" src="Reports/Gilles/UP-2017/Picture15.png" alt="" /></span></p>
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li class="report">The BSP&rsquo;s modest increase of vote share is somewhat counter-balanced by the fact that it loses ground in many more seats than it gains in others.</li>
<li class="report">This might confirm the fact that non-Jatav Dalit voters have deserted the BSP, especially compared to its composite victory of 2007.</li>
</ul>
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="preport"><strong>Modi</strong><strong> effect? </strong></p>
<ul>
<li class="report">Did the growing involvement of the Prime Minister in the campaign &ndash; especially in the last two-three phases &ndash; translated into better performance for the BJP? One way to measure that is to look at the evolution of parties strike rates through the phases of the election.</li>
<li class="report">The following chart indicates that the BJP started the campaign with a very high bar, with nearly 90 per cent strike rate. The SP became more competitive in the second phase, in Rohilkhand and the Northern parts of Western Uttar Pradesh.</li>
<li class="report">The performance of the BJP then remains stable. Its strike rate gradually increases from phase 2 to phase 5 but then decreases significantly, though not consequentially, in the 6th phase, to rebound slightly in the last phase.</li>
<li class="report">In short, this means that the phase effect of the campaign has been mild. It is of course possible that the Prime Minister&rsquo;s intervention enabled the party to retain its lead and stay above the 70 per cent strike rate mark. But it did not push the party to higher performance.</li>
</ul>
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="preport" style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img class="chart" src="Reports/Gilles/UP-2017/Picture17.png" alt="" /></span></p>
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="preport"><strong>Caste composition of the assembly: the return of the </strong><strong>Savarnas</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class="report">The BJP claims to win election through an inclusive platform based on development and on the inclusion of those who do not get representation from its adversaries, that is the non-Jatav Dalits and non-Yadav OBCs. Does the composition of the new assembly reflect that commitment to inclusion? Not quite.</li>
<li class="report">The return to power of the BJP signifies a resurgence of representation of the upper castes. The new assembly counts 44 per cent of upper caste MLAs, twelve per cent more than in 2012 and the highest share since 1980. Upper caste represent more than 50 per cent of the MLAs in Awadh, 43 per cent in Doab, 36.6 per cent in the East, 47 per cent in Bundelkhand, 52.5 per cent in North-Eastern U.P. and above a third of the MLAs in Rohilkhand and in Western U.P.</li>
<li class="report">Interestingly, the BJP&rsquo;s victory hasn&rsquo;t led to an overall gain of representation of OBCs, even though many of them won on BJP tickets.</li>
</ul>
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>
<hr />

<p class="preport" style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img class="chart" src="Reports/Gilles/UP-2017/Picture18.png" alt="" /></span></p>
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="preport"><strong>Caste composition of the assembly: the return of the </strong><strong>Savarnas</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class="report">If we break down these large caste groups into jati, we get a more precise idea of the changes at work.</li>
<li class="report">As far as the upper castes are concerned, it is essentially a rise of Thakurs and Banias. Brahmins&rsquo; representation remains stable.</li>
</ul>
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="preport" style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img class="chart" src="Reports/Gilles/UP-2017/Picture19.png" alt="" /></span></p>
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li class="report">As far as the OBCs are concerned, the Yadav representation falls at its lowest point, at 17 per cent of the OBC MLAs. The BJP strategy of keeping the dominant Yadav at bay is reflected in this chart. Kurmis&rsquo; representation increases from 11 to 28 per cent of the OBC contingent.</li>
<li class="report">Other lower OBCs, a key target of the BJP, also see their share of representation increasing. But again, on the overall, the overall OBC representation remains the same. Within that category, an historic churning has taken place.</li>
</ul>
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="preport" style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img class="chart" src="Reports/Gilles/UP-2017/Picture20.png" alt="" /></span></p>
<p class="preport" style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li class="report">The BJP distributed 48.6% of its tickets to upper castes, who make up for 48.2% of their MLAs.</li>
<li class="report">Lower OBCs received only 14.2% of the tickets, and represent 11.7% of the BJP&rsquo;s MLAs.</li>
<li class="report">SP distributed 17.4% of its tickets to Yadavs and 21.6% to Muslims. They make respectively 27.3 and 38.6% of their MLAs.</li>
<li class="report">BSP distributed 32.5% of its tickets to upper castes, who make 42.11% of their MLAs.</li>
<li class="report">BSP did not get a single Jatav Dalit elected.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>
<hr />

<p class="preport" style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img class="chart" src="Reports/Gilles/UP-2017/Picture21.png" alt="" /></span></p>
<p class="preport" style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li class="report">The Yadavs are not the only losing group in this election. Another target of exclusion of the BJP, the Muslims, also see their representation falling.</li>
<li class="report">The share of Muslim MLAs in the new assembly is the lowest it has seen since 1991, that is before Mandir.</li>
<li class="report">In 2012, Muslims had acquired for the first time a near proportionate representation in the Vidhan Sabha (17 per cent). It has now fallen to 6.2 per cent of the seats, due to the refusal of the BJP to field any minority candidate.</li>
</ul>
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li class="report">In total, and despite the BJP rhetoric of inclusion, the social composition of the assembly and of the BJP resembles the classic composition of the assembly when the BJP wins: a lion share of seats for the upper castes, a preferential representation of lower OBCs, and the exclusion of Yadavs and Muslims (at this time, we do not have sufficient data regarding the jati of SC MLAs).</li>
<li class="report">It is striking to realize how the BJP remains on classic tracks, in terms of strategy and discourse. The involvement of the Prime Minister and the focalization on development and opportunity for all, with an amount of signals to the Hindu base of the party, through short declarations, innuendos and acronyms, add an extra layer to a fairly vintage BJP strategy of consolidation of the upper caste and the lower OBCs.</li>
<li class="report">Just like in 2014, the BJP has added the new onto the old, rather than substituting the new for the old. The popularity of the Prime Minister enables the party to reach much further than it ever could. The failure, more than the defeat, of the Congress-SP alliance will worry those who seek to build a collective alternative to the BJP</li>
</ul>
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p class="preport">&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li class="report">BJP's vote share and strike rate are extremely high and consistent throughout the seven phases.</li>
<li class="report">The SP has managed to keep its vote share intact but the alliance with Congress dragged it down</li>
<li class="report">The BSP loses further its ability to mobilize beyond her core vote base</li>
<li class="report">&ldquo;floating voters&rdquo; are key and make solely caste centric electoral strategies ineffective</li>
